# War

## Design Approach

- 3 actors
  - player 1
  - player 2
  - game


game   - play-card   -> p1, p2  
p1, p2 - card-played -> game

each player has their stack of cards  
  get 'play-card' message? play card from top of stack

when cards played == number of players, game will figure out who won that hand

game - get-cards -> p1 or p2 (whoever won that round)
